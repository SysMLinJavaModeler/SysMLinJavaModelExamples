# SysMLinJava Model Examples
### Examples of using SysMLinJava for high precision MBSE

SysMLinJava is a Java-based model development kit (MDK) for high-precision modeling of executable SysML models in the Java programming language.  This repository contains nine example models that are based on SysMLinJava.   Each example can be downloaded and imported into a IDE as a project along with the SysMLinJava module in another project.  The examples are fully tested and can be compiled, built, and executed within the scope of the IDE project.
