 * Actuator model element of the DBS System model. The DBSActuator
 * models/simulates a system component that is embedded in the patient's brain
 * and receives control signals from the DBSController. It translates these
 * control signals into very small power signals, injecting them into the
 * patients brain to reduce his tremor.
